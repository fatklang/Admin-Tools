# Admin-Tools
A collection of PowerShell scripts built for Active Directory and system administration tasks.

See each individual script's readme for an explanation of usage.

## Roadmap

Below are the general administration domains for which I'm planning to write scripts.

Completed domains will have a checkmark below. Any scripts within an incomplete domain are works-in-progress, and may not have full functionality, or may produce unexpected results. Run incomplete scripts at your own risk.

- [ ] Active Directory Accounts - *Currently in ALPHA stage*
- [ ] Disks and Storage
- [ ] Services
- [ ] Printers
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] File Sharing
- [ ] Security
